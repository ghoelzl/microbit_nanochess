Hi, this is a demo of the Microbit nanochess and I will let it play against a training bot of chess.com
After starting Nanochess on the Microbit we are informed that white is to move.
By just pressing the 'B' button we choose, that Nanochess should calculate the next move for white.
After some seconds the calculated move is ready: The pawn moves from C2 to C4.
Now it is black's turn. 
As you can see in the browser window, black moved its pawn from C7 to C6. 
We enter the movement just with the 'A' and 'B' buttons: 'A' toggles between the characters or numbers and 'B' is for confirmation, like the Enter key on a keyboard.
After that the microbit confirms black's move.
And the procedure repeats itself.
Nanochess also checks the input. If you enter an illegal move, you will be prompted to make a new entry.
And here is the final move: Our Queen moves from B7 to G7 and black is checkmate.
But what happens if you enter an illegal move?
